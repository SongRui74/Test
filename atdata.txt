 Wish the previous version was still usable
 Missing the ability to rename transactions
 uses Touch ID
 This app needs an overhaul
 didn't help
 Just wish they would add Serve to ApplePay already
 Go back to the drawing board
 Plus no Touch ID
 Very limited accounts info and accessibility
  I wish the Monthly printouts had a better layout
 Log in is completely different
 This one lacks life color and distinction
 Sometimes it just takes a while to load
  Definitely not filing with it
 Please fix this or this app will become OBSOLETE
 Please fix this
-Freezes and crashes if you switch between apps
 When it does, it will crash
 It stays frozen
I can't even use this app for anything 
 Can't even open the app anymore, it just says   Cleaning
I have only successfully logged into the app twice
 This app doesn't work but it used to
 Miss the alarm clock
May 2 update crashes and is useless on iPhone 5 
 You'll just never know when you can log in
Really needs fixing
